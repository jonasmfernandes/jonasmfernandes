### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
 
I'm [**Jonas**](https://dev-jonas.vercel.app), a software developer based in Brazil. 

I like combining my technical knowledge with design to make beautiful and efficient applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.

Outside of work, I'm interested in furthering my knowledge in the tech world. I also build many side projects (most of them are in private repositories).

#### Fun Facts:
- I don't like tea.
- Stardew Valley is my favorite game.
