## About me 

My name is Jonas, I'm 17 years old and I'm a self-taught student. I am studying to become a complete front-end developer and in the future a fullstack. I am focused on Html, Css and JavaScript but always looking to learn more from each area, including web design. I like programming because with it we can revolutionize the world and bring a lot of automation and ease to us.
